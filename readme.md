# Project Description:
Scamazon is a web application that facilities the person-to-person sale of books. It allows sellers to create and manage listings of books to sell. Potential buyers are able to search and view existing listings. A buyer can add books they wish to purchase to their cart and checkout in order to finalize a sale. Admin users can view and manage existing listings and approve/disapprove newly created user accounts.

# Project Objectives:
- Program, in Javascript, a web application that handles user verification and requests to interact with the project's database.
- Program a Python API to manage the project database
- Allow interaction between the front end GUI on the website and the Python API to manage the database

# Project Features:
- Users can create buyer or seller accounts, log in, and log out.
- Buyers can browse available books, buy books, return books, and search for specific books
- Sellers can create a listing for a book, receive (mock) payments, and remove a listing they created
- Admins can audit account creation and modify/remove existing book listings.

# Languages and Techniques Used:
-Frontend built with HTML5/CSS3 and potentially Javascript if necessary
-Backend communications and routing built with Django 5.0 using Python 3.12
-Database built with MySQL 8.0
